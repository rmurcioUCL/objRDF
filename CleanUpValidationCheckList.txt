Clean Up - This should be done before run the iF2RDF program
Strip fields from <, >, #
Transform / to - (just to play safe)
Transform Scientific notation (xxxExx) to regular notation

Validation process - This is done while we're reading the csv

Validation Action
Empty Fields(no id fields) Create empty string - log P1
Empty Fields(id fields) No import - log P2
Numeric (no Lat/Long) Create empty string - log P1 Numeric (Lat/Long) ?Maybe No - log P2
Fields with 'None' No import - log P2
Strange patterns* Create empty string - log P1

A strange pattern is when in a field the majority of the records are for example alphanumerics and only one or two are numerics.
P1 and P2 are log files that contain the precise info for each problematic record
