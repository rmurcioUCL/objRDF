# objRDF
piece 2 transform an input (text-based) file into a particular RDF format
Several issues with this file in this version
   + Uncomment projection to use pyproj
   + unique key is not in the correct format (xxxxx)   -  see Steven code to fix this
   + Dicctionaries!!!
   + Order or the triplets
   + Review fields
   + verbose address . Are we doing them for London?
   + BNode ()  -  think if is the correct way to do it
   + We need a way to figure out the init format of the file
