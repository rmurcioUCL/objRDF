trainStation Readme

Generates TTL for train stations - data derived from open sourced rail reference data:...?
Source file covers the whole of the UK so needs to be cleaned to include stations within Greater London. Still incomplete as it does not include DLR stations etc. Tube stations are covered by Agata, and can be found on a separate script. 
Script is base on the if2RDF05.py file found in murcioUCL/objRDF
